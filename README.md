## Notes/Retro

This was a fun time-boxed JavaScript challenge. I don't often have time for sideprojects, so i wanted to get some mileage with the technologies below:

| thing             | new  | notes |
|:------------------|:----:|:------|
| react hooks       | :white_check_mark: | work stuff is all 16.6 |
| `RxJS`          | :warning: | never with react app |
| `react-testing-lib` | :white_check_mark: | waiting to try this for |
| cra@3             |  | loving cra@2, what's new? |
| typescript        | :warning: | never with react |
| bootstrap@4 |  |  | 
| [s]css.modules | | :man_shrugging: styled components? I still like this |

### Outcomes

Abandoned most unit testing after evaluating `react-testing-library`. _Yes!_, I prefer over `enzyme` now that i've had opportunity to use both. RxJS is still wicked cool (haven't used since worked on last angular). Hooks are pretty slick! My intuitive rationale about the value of updating my work projects is confirmed. As lots of folks have said, piecewise migration after your project can update to 16.8 is the way to go. Best practices and patterns for hooks is still emerging, and I think i'm in the right car on the hype train. Using CRA3: From 2, didn't affect my workflow at all (_great!_) and the benefit of hooks + 1st class TS in [3](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#300-april-22-2019) is a welcome benefit. TypeScript is still wicked cool. Using in react was pretty intuitive, but resources like [@swyx's react-ts-cheatsheet](https://github.com/typescript-cheatsheets/react-typescript-cheatsheet) were helpful. BootStrap4: just an 'ol familiar that ships scss. [S]CSS-module for style encapsulation? This is still my favorite way of doing it... No appetite for re-evaluating css-in-js stuff right now.
